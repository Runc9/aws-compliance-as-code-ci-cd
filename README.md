## 1. üß† Overview

**Scenario**: You're a GRC engineer managing 100+ AWS accounts across multiple regions. Your mission? Enforce compliance with CIS, NIST 800-53, and ISO 27001 ‚Äî not manually, but through scalable, automated AWS Config rules delivered as code.

This repo demonstrates how to:
- Transform written security controls into auditable AWS Config rules
- Deploy rules using GitHub Actions + CloudFormation
- Automate compliance enforcement across environments with traceability and version control

## 3. üéØ Lab Objectives

- ‚úÖ Define a managed AWS Config rule (IAM_PASSWORD_POLICY)
- ‚úÖ Convert it into JSON format with tagging metadata
- ‚úÖ Write a CloudFormation template for reusable deployments
- ‚úÖ Configure GitHub Actions to validate + deploy rules on push
- ‚úÖ Store AWS credentials securely using GitHub Secrets

## 5. How It Works

All AWS Config rules are defined as `.json` files inside the `config-rules/` folder.

The rule is deployed via `templates/config-rule-template.yaml`.

On every Git push to `config-rules/` or `templates/`, GitHub Actions automatically:

- Validates the rule format
- Loads AWS credentials from GitHub Secrets
- Deploys the rule using `aws cloudformation deploy`


## 6. CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

| Stage                     | Description                                              |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `Checkout`                | Fetches code from the GitHub repository                  |
| `Configure AWS Credentials` | Loads secrets into the runner environment              |
| `CloudFormation Deploy`   | Applies the config rule using AWS CLI                    |


## 7. Skills Demonstrated

- AWS Config (managed rule deployment)
- CloudFormation (parameterized infrastructure as code)
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD automation)
- GitHub Secrets (secure credential handling)
- Compliance-as-Code implementation
- IAM control enforcement
- Multi-region deployment automation
